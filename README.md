# Kickstarting with Excel

## 

### Purpose. Gain insight on how Different Campaigns performed based on their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date.
	Analyized all fundraising efforts across the Theater category focusing on the results sorted by the month regardless of the year. Based on the data the highest number of successful outcomes was in the month of May. The other high success months were clustered around May with June, July and August having the next most successful months. Based on these results, the best time of year to fund raise for a Theater production appears to be in the late spring and mid-summer months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	Analyzied the outcomes based on funding goal across the Play category only. Based on the attached data in general the lower the funding goal the higher chance of reaching the goal. Funding goals of less than $20,000 had a success rate of between 60% and 75% depending on funding goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	My challenges with the exercise were with Outcomes based on goals spreadsheet. I had issues with the Countis function and setting the range limits in the code. Was able to tinker and get them to work properly.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	Late spring to mid-summer seems to be the best time to fundraise for Theater productions. Late fall and the winter months are the least successful months.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	In general the lower the funding goal the better is the chance of success. There were 769 fundraising efforts trying to raise $5,000 or less and they were 75% successful. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	Our data for launch date was for all theater productions. Our data for goals was limited to only the subcategory of plays. This may not give a true picture of expected results.
	There were not many fundraising efforts trying to raise more that $25,000 which may skew are results.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	I would want to analyze goals data across all Theater categories.
